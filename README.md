# Tic Tac Toe

A tic-tac-toe game built in Vue.

The stack for this app includes:

1. Vue.js v3
2. TailwindCSS
3. VueX
4. Parcel
5. SCSS
6. Typescript

I built this app so I could learn:

1. State, Mutations and Actions in VueX.
2. Using the Parcel Bundler with Vue and Tailwind.
3. Configuring Tailwind in Vue
4. The use of `watch`, `watchEffect` and the `unwatch` functions.
5. Component Slots.
6. Fallthrough attributes.
